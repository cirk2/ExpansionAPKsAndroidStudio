Importing the google play expansion library to Android Studio isn't easy and the [documentation](http://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html) only tells you how to do it with Eclipse.

So this is a library of pre-imported projects, which were first loaded in to eclipse, then the project imported to Android Studio:

- Google Play APK Expansion Library rev. 3
- Google Play Licensing Library rev. 2
